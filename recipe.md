# {{PROBLEM}} Function Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

<!-- 
As a user
So that I can find my tasks among all my notes
I want to check if a line from my notes includes the string `#TODO`. 
-->


## 2. Design the Function Signature

_Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

<!-- 
Function to let us know if the line contains #TODO
def includes_todo(notes):
    Return True if #TODO is in the notes


 -->

```python
# EXAMPLE

def extract_uppercase(mixed_words):
    """Extracts uppercase words from a string

    Parameters: (list all parameters and their types)
        mixed_words: a string containing words (e.g. "hello WORLD")

    Returns: (state the return value and its type)
        a list of strings, each one a word (e.g. ["WORLD"])

    Side effects: (state any side effects)
        This function doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects
    """
    pass # Test-driving means _not_ writing any code here yet.
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._

<!--
    tests includes 'Take the bins out #TODO'
    assert True

def test_includes_todo()

    tests includes 'take the bins out'
    assert False

def test_doesnt_inlcude_TODO()


    tests includes '#todo' in lower case
    assert True

    either upper() or lower()

  -->





```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a lower and an uppercase word
It returns a list with the uppercase word
"""
extract_uppercase("hello WORLD") => ["WORLD"]

"""
Given two uppercase words
It returns a list with both words
"""
extract_uppercase("HELLO WORLD") => ["HELLO", "WORLD"]

"""
Given two lowercase words
It returns an empty list
"""
extract_uppercase("hello world") => []

"""
Given a lower and a mixed case word
It returns an empty list
"""
extract_uppercase("hello WoRLD") => []

"""
Given a lowercase word and an uppercase word with an exclamation mark
It returns a list with the uppercase word, no exclamation mark
"""
extract_uppercase("hello WORLD!") => ["WORLD"]

"""
Given an empty string
It returns an empty list
"""
extract_uppercase("") => []

"""
Given a None value
It throws an error
"""
extract_uppercase(None) throws an error
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

Here's an example for you to start with:

```python
# EXAMPLE

from lib.extract_uppercase import *

"""
Given a lower and an uppercase word
It returns a list with the uppercase word
"""
def test_extract_uppercase_with_upper_then_lower():
    result = extract_uppercase("hello WORLD")
    assert result == ["WORLD"]
```

Ensure all test function names are unique, otherwise pytest will ignore them!
